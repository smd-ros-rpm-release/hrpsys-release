%description
An OpenRTM-aist-based robot controller. This package is the most tailored for
humanoid (dual-arm and/or biped) robots for historical reason. hrpsys package
does not only wraps but build and installs the code from its mainstream
repository (github.com/fkanehiro/hrpsys-base). The package version number is
synchronized to that of mainstream, based on this decision. Its semantics:
MAJOR: Synchronized with OpenHRP3 MINOR: Indicate IDL compatibility (packages
with different version numbers in this section are NOT compatible) PATCH:
Packages with different version numbers in this section ARE compatible. API
document is auto-generated on github.
